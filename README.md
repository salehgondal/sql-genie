# SQL Genie 🧞‍♂️

SQL Genie is a command-line assistant that turns natural language questions into SQL queries,
and executes them against a database.

## Project Goals

- Practice building an LLM-powered "agent" that:
  - Understands natural language questions
  - Generates SQL for a known schema
  - Validates the SQL and executes it

- Produce a portfolio-ready project with clear code and documentation.

## High-Level Flow

1. User asks a question in plain English.
2. The model generates a SQL query for the target schema.
3. SQL Genie shows the generated SQL.
4. Optionally execute the query against a SQLite database and return results.
5. Handle errors and give user-friendly feedback.


## Setup (Work in Progress)

Instructions will be added as the project evolves.
